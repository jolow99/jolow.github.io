  ## Hello world

I'm a Singapore-based engineer and researcher working towards building more meaningful and durable communities.


**Currently:**
  * I run the research fellowship programme at [DAOstar](https://daostar.substack.com/p/meet-our-daostar-research-fellows?triedRedirect=true) 
  * I am writing a paper analyzing Singapore's role in [Public AI](https://publicai.network/) 

**Research:**

My research is on the intersection of DAOs, AI and Community. 
  - I wrote a paper on the [State of DAOs in Singapore](https://daostar.org/reports/singapore.pdf)
  - I gave a talk at [Devcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zy3C3pYh48) and organized the [DAO Asia Summit](https://lu.ma/r85s879b) 
  - I completed my master's thesis proposing an [ontology of community](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mGGbRB-wRQjVeaM8hH9InY8x6WBCpx_C/view?usp=sharing)

**Events:**

I am involved in a range of communities and try to actively contribute wherever I can

- I hosted an event about the [commodification of community](https://partiful.com/e/kI8MqZSjBeyIriHGSFPs) with Strangerconvos

**Projects**

Most of my projects have been in the web3 space.
